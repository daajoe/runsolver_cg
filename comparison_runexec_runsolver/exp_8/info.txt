This is experiment was done to check if cgroups slows down the speed of a process, i.e. increases the runtime.
The comparison was done running ffmpeg 100 times.
Once with runsolver and again as standalone.
The command for runexec is:
runexec --output output/output.txt ./ffmpeg.sh > stdout_runexec/stdout.txt 2>stderr_runexec/stderr.txt
The command for standalone is:
./ffmpeg.sh > output/stdout.log 2>output/stderr.log
