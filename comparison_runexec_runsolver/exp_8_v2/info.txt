This is experiment was done to check if cgroups slows down the speed of a process, i.e. increases the runtime.
It is similar to experiment 8 but a bigger conversion file is chosen to increase the effective runtime and also to only run once instead of 100 times.
The experiment is repeated 10 times.
Once with runsolver and again as standalone.
The command for runexec is:
runexec --output output/output_$i.log ./ffmpeg.sh > output/stdout_$i.log 2>output/stderr_$i.log
The command for standalone is:
./ffmpeg.sh > output/stdout.log 2>output/stderr.log
