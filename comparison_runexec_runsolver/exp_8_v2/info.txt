This experiment is similar to experiement 8.
A bigger conversion file is chosen to increase the effective runtime and also to only run once instead of 100 times.
The experiment is repeated 10 times.
Once with runsolver and again as standalone.
The command for runexec is:
runexec --output output/output.txt ./ffmpeg.sh > stdout_runexec/stdout.txt 2>stderr_runexec/stderr.txt
The command for standalone is:
./ffmpeg.sh > output/stdout.log 2>output/stderr.log
